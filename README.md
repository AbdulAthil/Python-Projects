# Python-Projects

In here,I have done four projects using various concepts of python such as conditions, loops, functions and OOPS.
The projects are,

## Banking Management System
  * In this project, I have created a banking management system for a user to 
   <b>create an account </b> and 
   <b>deposit and withdrew money from their account</b> and 
   <b>check balance and get statement for their account</b>.
  * So,user can create an account by enter their basic details and they can generate their secret pin number.
  * Account won't be generated if the pin number and account holder name matches with previous users account details.
  * Account number and Customer ID will be generated automatically.
  * User can deposit,withdrew money from their account and user can also check their account balance and get statement by using their secret pin number and their name.
  
## Coffee Vendor Machine 
  * In this project, I have created a program for coffee vendor machine which produces three types of coffees such as <b>Espresso</b> and <b>Latte</b> and <b>Cappuccino</b>
  * User can get any of these three coffees from the machine if the machine has required water,milk and coffee 
  and also if the user enters the required money to the machine to start the coffee making process.
  * We can turn off the machine if we enter correct employee id and the keyword.
  
## Flight Ticket Reservation System
  * In this project,i have created a flight ticket reservation system for a airline which has two flights and two classes for each flights.
  * User can book a ticket in this two flights if the tickets are available at the moment.
  * And user also can be cancel a ticket. But the cancellation fee will be collected from the user.
  * Any user can see the availability of seats in two flights and their respective classes.

## Hotel Food Order Taking Machine
  * In this project,i have created a program for a food order taking machine which can be used in hotels.
  * The waiter can place customer's orders from the customer place(table) and no need to go to the kitchen to tell the customer's orders
  * And they can also generate bill for the orders to give the bill to the customers and the bill will be automatically updated to the billing section.
  * Customer can't cancel a single or multiple items from the order. If they want to cancel any item they have to cancel the complete order and make a new order.
  * If the customer wants to add another item in their order, the order and the bill will be added separately and combines with the previous order.
